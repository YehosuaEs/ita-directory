# IT Academy Directory

The IT Academy Directory is a project built with React.js and Note.js for and from students of the IT Academy from Barcelona Activa following the React.js and Node.js tracks.

One of the purposes of this project is to allow students to deal with new features, legacy code, fixes and teamwork challenges. As a consequence the priority is not only excellent technical execution, but to provide a full learning experience to our students.
